# Dominos

<h3> How to use Dominos </h3>
The class that has the entry point is "Dominos". There are no command line arguments to worry about. 
The biggest thing is that you must know to click on the Domino in your hand to then press the left or right buttons for placement on the board.

<h3>Debugging/Testing tools</h3>
There are some print statements that can be used with the source code to debug and there are some public static final DEBUG statements that will use most of the debug statements, especially in the Gameboard, DominoPiece, and Player where a lot of early unit testing was needed.



<h3>Part of the program</h3>
I, Chris, did all part of the program in writing. There were ideas and whatnot that were gotten from the internet and/or friends. But all code was written by me.



<h3>Know Issues</h3>
- When the game is over from the computer winning, the board doesn't update until after the user dismisses the dialog box.
- When the game is over, the stagger alignment from on the board disappears.
